## Effective deFi portfolio management.

Why deFi? To effectively allocate to the best assets at the best quantities, needs
large compute. And why not be able to go directly to the market? 
Yes, we are going to disrupt the investment management industry.
The aim is to get the most return for the least risk and outperform some benchmark.
Max(active risk adjusted return)

## The theory:

### On the introduction of the base dimensions:

Risk and return are the first two base dimensions, 
where the latter gets more attention.
Risk, in recent years have gathered more attention, probably
because of fear and excessive leverage in the system.
Each asset has a return and risk profile. Return is calculated by the percentage
change in price from time 0 to time 1. Risk is the standard deviation of a set of these
returns.

When one has a portfolio of these risk and return profiles,
one has to assign weights to each asset/group/classification/characteristic. This brings us to
the third base dimension, namely exposure. Exposure always sums up to one,
where shorts are < 0.

The last base dimension is something we are calling relativity. 
This is how one compares one asset to another or a group of assets to a benchmark.
Intra portfolio it is done by the co-variance between assets. Inter portfolios
we focus on differences between risk, return and exposures.
